## Halloween

Somewhere during the halloween/fall theme period, you can see blocks glow and a hand pointing...

### Ghost hand ðŸ‘‡

Don't be scared, it's just a friendly ghost indication how your previous play was before you got **blocked**. Will you follow in your own footsteps and get blocked in the same way? Or will you change your fate and your puzzle outcome?
