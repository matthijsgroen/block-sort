## Basic play

- Click on a column to select the top blocks of a same kind.
- Click another column to stack the blocks on a block of the same kind.

## Hidden blocks (hard levels)

`?` Blocks hide their identity. When they become the top block, their identity will be revealed.

## Locked columns

Some columns can only contain blocks of a certain type. They are marked with their symbol.

## Zen mode ðŸŒ»

When you reach level **30** 'zen' mode will be unlocked where you can choose a difficulty level and level type from your unlocked difficulties and modes.

## Getting stuck?

Keep trying!

- Think a few moves ahead to see if you can keep a column or buffer clear, to keep your options open.
- Try to remember the choices you made in your previous try, or which blocks where hidden where.
- If you fail more than 15 times, an **Auto move** button will appear, and will give you some hints how to start, and the number of auto moves will increase in further tries.
