Welcome to Block Sort! This small guide will help you understand the mechanics in play.

## Basic play

Click / Tap columns

- Click / Tap on a column to select the top blocks of a same kind.
- Click / Tap another column to stack the blocks on a block of the same kind.

Drag motion

- Press mouse / Touch and hold on a column to select the top blocks of a same kind.
- Move to another column while keeping pressed / touched.
- Release at another column to stack the blocks on a block of the same kind.

Some mechanics can change during a **seasonal event**. If that happens, this guide will have a section about that in the bottom.

## Hidden blocks (hard levels)

`?` Blocks hide their identity. When they become the top block, their identity will be revealed.

## Locked columns

Some columns can only contain blocks of a certain type. They are marked with their symbol.

## Zen mode ðŸŒ»

When you reach level **30** 'zen' mode will be unlocked where you can choose a difficulty level and level type from your unlocked difficulties and modes.

## Getting stuck?

Keep trying!

- Think a few moves ahead to see if you can keep a column or buffer clear, to keep your options open.
- Try to remember the choices you made in your previous try, or which blocks where hidden where.

### Auto moves

If you fail more than 15 times, an **Auto move** button will appear, and will give you some hints how to start, and the number of auto moves will increase in further tries, but no further than half the solve.

By pressing the auto move button, the game will perform one move for you. The number on the button will decrease by one. You can keep pressing this button until all moves are depleted. The moves will return if you restart the level. If you perform a move of your own, the auto move button will disappear.
