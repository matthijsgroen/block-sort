# Refreshing the installation on Android

On Android, there is always a single version of the game. If you would go to the [block sort website](https://matthijsgroen.github.io/block-sort/), It would reopen the PWA.

Storing your data as precaution:

1. Open the old version of the game (the versions of both games would be the same)
2. Go to _settings_ -> _Advanced_ -> _Transfer game data_ -> _Export game data_
3. Long press the QR code, and save this to the images on your phone

Now you should be able to delete the current installation. If the system asks to keep the data, **keep** it.

If you would now visit the [block sort website](https://matthijsgroen.github.io/block-sort/) again, an install prompt should appear.

The app is now re-installed and still has its data.

If the data is gone, take the following steps:

1. Open the new installation
2. Go to _settings_ -> _Advanced_ -> _Transfer game data_ -> _Import game data_
3. Choose _picture library_
4. Select the image with the QR code
5. Confirm the import ðŸŽ‰
