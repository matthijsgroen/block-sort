# Refreshing the installation on iOS

On iOS, you can actually have multiple versions of the same Progressive Web App next to each other. In this case that is beneficial, because you can check if all data is properly transferred before you remove the old version.

1. Visit the [block sort website](https://matthijsgroen.github.io/block-sort/) in your browser.
2. Press share _(From the browser interface, not the game!)_.
3. Add to home screen

You should now have 2 versions of the game. The old one with all your data, and the new one that starts at level 1.

Transferring data:

1. Open the old version of the game (the versions of both games would be the same)
2. Go to _settings_ -> _Advanced_ -> _Transfer game data_ -> _Export game data_
3. Long press the QR code, and save this to the images on your phone
4. Open the new installation
5. Go to _settings_ -> _Advanced_ -> _Transfer game data_ -> _Import game data_
6. Choose _picture library_
7. Select the image with the QR code
8. Confirm the import ðŸŽ‰

Verify if everything is on order, and you can now remove your previous game!
