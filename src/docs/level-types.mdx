There are multiple level types in the game

## Normal levels

In these levels, you sort blocks between 'placement' columns. Only in the highest difficulty you will encounter buffers.
Some columns can be locked to specific block types. Indicated by their icon.

## Special levels ⭐️

These levels use different blocks. The use buffers more often, and can vary from really long columns, or lots of small columns,

## Hard levels 🔥

In hard levels, blocks are hidden. When they become the top block, their identity will be revealed. In these levels its good to remember what was hidden, so in subsequent tries you figure out how to solve the puzzle.

## Scrambled levels 🧩

In these levels someone already did some moves, so chances are you start with a partial solve, but also probably without any empty columns...

## Easy levels 🍀

These are levels that are 1 or even multiple difficulty levels below your current difficulty, as lucky break!

## Dungeon levels 🐉

These levels have a twist! Enemies and traps are in these levels, and you must defeat them!

## Seasonal level types

During some seasons, new level types might pop-up! Don't worry, these levels appear also if the theme slider is off.
