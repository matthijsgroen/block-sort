## Zen mode ðŸŒ»

When you reach level **30** 'zen' mode will be unlocked.

Here you can choose a difficulty level and level type from your unlocked difficulties and modes.

You unlock new level types and difficulty levels with progression on the main track.

This is a 'free play' mode, if you want to control what type of level or difficulty you want to play.

You can adjust the 'Hint Mode' slider in the settings when playing in Zen mode, without breaking your 'Hint mode off' streak.

**Don't forget to set the slider back before continuing levels on your main track though!**
