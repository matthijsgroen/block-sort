# How to refresh installation

**Block Sort** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA). In layman's terms, it is an installable website that can be used offline.

This website provides a configuration file to the OS telling it how to behave. While I can update the game by publishing new updates, this configuration file will never update until the PWA is re-installed.

## What is in this configuration file?

The configuration file describes how the screen of your phone is used, what icon the app has on your home screen, and if the app should only be running in portrait mode. (this last thing is not respected on iOS devices)

Some updates done updated this configuration file, like:

- **0.5.0** - 2024-09-27 (updated App logo)
- **1.6.1** - 2024-10-08 (locked to portrait for Android)
- **1.21.0** - 2024-11-13 (show background behind status bar)
- **1.21.0** - 2024-11-13 (show background behind status bar)
- **1.29.0** - 2024-11-30 (display PWA fullscreen)

If you installed the game **after 2024-11-30** there is no need for reinstallation.
But even then, if none of the updates are interesting to you, feel free to not reinstall.

In these sections I will guide you through the process of updating your installation, without loss of data.
