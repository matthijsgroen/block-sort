import { AutoMove } from "@/ui/AutoMove/AutoMove";

## Basic play

Click / Tap columns

- Click / Tap on a column to select the top blocks of a same kind.
- Click / Tap another column to stack the blocks on a block of the same kind.

Drag motion

- Press mouse / Touch and hold on a column to select the top blocks of a same kind.
- Move to another column while keeping pressed / touched.
- Release at another column to stack the blocks on a block of the same kind.

Some mechanics can change during a **seasonal event**. If that happens, this guide will have a section about that in the bottom.

## Getting stuck?

Keep trying!

- Think a few moves ahead to see if you can keep a column or buffer clear, to keep your options open.
- Try to remember the choices you made in your previous try, or which blocks where hidden where.

### Auto moves

If you fail more than 15 times, an <span className="-mx-4 scale-75 inline-block"><AutoMove autoMoves={5} /></span> button will appear, and will give you some hints how to start, and the number of auto moves will increase in further tries.

By pressing the auto move button, the game will perform one move for you. The number on the button will decrease by one. You can keep pressing this button until all moves are depleted. The moves will return if you restart the level. If you perform a move of your own, the auto move button will disappear.

You can configure in the **settings** if you want hints to appear earlier, or not at all.
