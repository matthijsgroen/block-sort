## Spring

It's Spring! Nature will start blossoming again!

### Rainbow levels ðŸŒˆ

During this season a new level type is available, **Rainbow levels**. These levels only have one temporary placement buffer.

But, in these buffers you can stack all kinds of blocks on top of each other!

If that's a blessing or a curse is up to you!

Have fun!
